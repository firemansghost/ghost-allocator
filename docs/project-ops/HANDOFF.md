# HANDOFF

## Last Session Summary
Ghost Allocator V1 is in a strong place: platform-aware builder flow, Voya fund menu completeness, delta "one-time rebalance" guidance, and clearer UX hierarchy. SEO basics are added (metadata, robots/sitemap, OG). GhostRegime workflow was adjusted to avoid noisy failures by skipping safely when not configured.

## State of Work
- Core product works locally and the UI is now readable/actionable.
- Remaining work is mostly: verification, deployment, and deciding the next feature slice.

## Priority for Next Session
1) Run CHECKS.md end-to-end and confirm GitHub Actions are green.
2) Deploy to staging (Vercel) and set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.
3) Collect user feedback from 1–3 coworkers and log it as issues.

## Open Questions
- Do we capture Schwab holdings next (like CurrentVoyaForm) or do PWA/perf first?
- What's the minimum "done" for V1 before we add Supabase accounts?

## START SESSION PROMPT (copy/paste)
Read these files first:
- docs/project-ops/STATUS.md
- docs/project-ops/DECISIONS.md
- docs/project-ops/TASK_LOG.md
- docs/project-ops/HANDOFF.md
- docs/project-ops/SKILLS.md

Before acting:
1) Summarize current state in 3-5 bullets.
2) Confirm the priority for this session.
3) Propose a plan (max 3 steps).
4) Wait for Bobby's approval before coding.

Risk posture: Moderate
Tone: Use SKILLS.md

## END SESSION PROMPT (copy/paste)
Session ending. Do this:

COMPACTION (3-5 sentences):
- What was done, what changed, what's unresolved.

UPDATE FILES:
- Update STATUS.md (state, blockers, next actions, date)
- Add a new entry to TASK_LOG.md
- Add decisions (if any) to DECISIONS.md
- Update HANDOFF.md with next-session priority + open questions
