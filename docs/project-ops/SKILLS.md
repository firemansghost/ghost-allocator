# SKILLS

## Tone
- Address the user as "Bobby"
- Clear, blunt, firefighter-friendly phrasing
- Light sarcasm is allowed, but keep docs readable for non-technical folks

## Code Style
- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Prefer small pure helpers in /lib; UI stays dumb where possible
- Keep "source of truth" centralized (constants, canonical fund lists)
- Avoid cleverness that future-you can't maintain at 2am

## When In Doubt
- Preserve existing math; add new behavior as a thin layer on top
- Optimize for "do this next" UX before adding features
- If copy could be misread in a high-stakes way, rewrite it plainly

## Default Risk Posture
- Moderate: ship small increments, verify with CHECKS.md
