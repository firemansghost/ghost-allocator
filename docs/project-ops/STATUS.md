# STATUS

## Current State
Ghost Allocator V1 is functional and firefighter-friendly: pension-aware onboarding, Voya-only and Voya+Schwab paths, full OKC Voya fund menu, delta "one-time rebalance" guidance, and a black/gold glass UI. SEO basics (metadata helper, robots/sitemap, OG image) are in place. GhostRegime exists as a secondary tool and its scheduled workflow has been "tamed" to skip safely when not configured.

## What done looks like

### V1 (MVP Foundation)
- Working onboarding/builder for both platforms (Voya-only, Voya+Schwab)
- Canonical Voya menu (full OKC fund list)
- Delta logic (one-time rebalance guidance)
- OKC Voya-first copy (payroll lands in Voya, manual Schwab sweeps)
- Docs/checks (project-ops pack, verification checklist)
- Workflows non-noisy (skip guards, safe Slack notify)
- Deployable (builds cleanly, staging-ready)

### V1.1 (Trust & polish)
- Model portfolios locked + reviewed outputs for each risk band/platform path
- GhostRegime UI polish (cards/layout/hierarchy improvements)

## Blockers
- Verify GitHub Actions are now green (workflow YAML + skip guard + Slack notify logic).
- Confirm production deployment plan (Vercel or Convex) and set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.

## Next Actions
1) Create model portfolio spec + acceptance criteria (V1.1)
2) Add a review harness page or dev script to snapshot outputs across risk bands (V1.1)
3) GhostRegime UI polish pass (V1.1)
